`cnn_train.ipynb` is used for training cnn with different epoches and kernel sizes, the result `.pt` file and log file such as `kernel=3,epochs=100_train.txt` and `kernel=3,epochs=100_validation.txt` (things like train and validation log files) are stored at `./drugfinder/plot/res` , note that `.drugfinder/plot/res` is ignored by `.gitignore`, so you should run `cnn_train.ipynb` by youself if you want to get in touch with the entire work

`cnn.py` is used for plotting cnn of different kernel and for Jamali drugminer data, also the `fpr` and `tpr` are also calculted but have not been used, you can write the code to save them if necessary and plot them using the script `drurgfinder/cnn.py`, **Note: Before running `cnn.py`, please make sure to run `cnn_train.ipynb` for reference purposes.**
